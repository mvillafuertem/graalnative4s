Employ Scala for serverless workloads by using GraalVM native-image and Google Cloud Run.

## Rationale
I was wondering what is a good combination of purely functional Scala libraries that are easy to compile to a native-image. Well, and what do you do with a small image that starts up fast?

### Build
Use `sbt docker` to build the docker image locally. The Dockerfile provides or downloads all required GraalVM tooling. You don't need to install anything. Nonetheless, [the image will be as minimal as possible](https://github.com/users/usommerl/packages/container/package/graalnative4s) by using a multi-stage build.

### Deploy
The [Github actions workflow](.github/workflows/ci_cd.yaml) will deploy the created image continuously. You could also use the Cloud Run button to allow others to deploy your application to their GCP accounts.
